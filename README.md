# CSGO_Match_Data_CSV_Generator

Uses node.js module [HLTV](https://github.com/gigobyte/HLTV) to gather professional CS:GO match results and reformat it into a CSV file that can be used in data mining.

## Usage
I recommend installing [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and using it to install node and npm.

Run `node index` in the command line.
